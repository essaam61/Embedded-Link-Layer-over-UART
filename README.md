# Embedded-Link-Layer-over-UART
Implemented a UART serial communication protocol between two microcontrollers (Arm Cortex-M4 Tiva C board and Arduino Uno board) and the sender produces an ETHERNET compatible frame encapsulating the data and the receiver validates the frame and extracts the data back.
